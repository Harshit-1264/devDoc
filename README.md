# 📘 devDoc — AI-Powered Smart Document Search & Q&A

devDoc is an advanced full-stack GenAI application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), process YouTube videos, crawl websites, and ask natural-language questions about the content.
The system uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Vector Databases, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to deliver fast, precise, context-aware answers.

The project blends modern full-stack development with AI-oriented architecture including Next.js, Node.js, Qdrant Cloud, and LangChain.js.
